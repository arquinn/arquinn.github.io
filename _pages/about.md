My research group builds better systems to help developers build better systems.
I work at the intersection of operating systems, architecture, programming
languages, and software engineering, but I'm primarily a "system's guy".  I have
or am working on testing, debugging, bug fixes, FPGAs, persistent memory, memory
consistency models, GPUs, secure delete, far memory, CXL, WebAssembly, edge
computing, replication, and migration.  If any of this interests you, let's
talk!
