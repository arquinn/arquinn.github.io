I am a junior professor at UC Santa Cruz who explores techniques and
builds systems for improving software reliability.  In the long run,
my goal is to simplify the developer effort required to build
efficient software systems.  During my Ph.D., I explored a new
framework for inspecting the runtime behavior of a software system.  I
proposed a data-oriented model that treats software executions like
data objects and allows us to apply data-oriented techniques, such as
massive-scale parallelization and relational query models, to
debugging, security forensics, data provenance, and configuration
management.  The systems presented in my thesis offer order of
magnitude improvements over current state-of-the-art techniques.

Recently, I've also looked at systems support to improve the
reliability of persistent memory applications (Hippocrates and
Agamotto) and to provide better trade-offs for record and replay (ER).

If you're interesting in building more reliable software systems,
let's talk!
