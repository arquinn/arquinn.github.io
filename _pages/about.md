My goal is to make it easier for developers to build correct and
efficient software systems.  I have a developer-focused approach to
research: I focus on the fixing the problems facing developers when
building large-scale applications.  My work is in the intersection
between operating systems, architecture, programming languages, and
software engineering, but I primarily consider myself a [``systems
person''](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf).

Most of my work is about bugs: finding them, understanding them, and
fixing them.  For example, my dissertation proposed data-centric
execution inspection, a data-oriented approach for analyzing the
runtime behavior of a software system.  My thesis treats software
executions like data objects and thus enables the use of data-oriented
techniques, such as massive-scale parallelization and relational query
models, for software engineering tasks like debugging, security
forensics, data provenance, and configuration management.  Currently,
I'm exploring how data-centric execution inspection enables better
distributed systems debugging, runtime verification, and could be
improved through automated learning.


I also explore the the intersection of software reliability and
emerging hardware technologies.  For example, we improved the
reliability of persistent memory applications by automatically finding
bugs (Agamotto) and fixing bugs (Hippocrates) in these applications.
We performed the first study of bugs in, and software-like debugging
tools for, FPGA circuits (Brave New World) and are continuing to work
on reliability techniques in this space (coming soon!).  Finally, I'm
working with a group at UCSC to improve the reliability of GPUs
(coming soon!).

Lastly, we are investigating the reliability and performance of
applications in disaggregated computing.  We're studying the
performance implications of using these system and proposing solutions
to mitigate bottlenecks.  

If any of this interests you, let's talk!
