My Student, Yiwei Yang, presented two (!) work in progress projects at the HCDS
workshop collocated with ASPLOS and Eurosys 2025.  The projects work on tracing
and observability for CXL pooling systems and GPUs.  Particularly impressive,
Yiwei and her other coauthors did *most* of the work themselves 💁‍♀️! Congrats!
