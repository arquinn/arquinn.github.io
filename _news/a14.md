[Pathfinder](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3720431) was accepted at OOPSLA '25!
ðŸ™Œ The work prestents representative testing, a new technique that scales
crash-consistency testing by identifying and testing crash states that are
representative rather than testing all possible crash states.  This work was a
long time in the making and represents many hours of blood, sweat, and tears.
Congrats to all my coauthors!
