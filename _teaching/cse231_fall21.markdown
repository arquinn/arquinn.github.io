## Course Information

CSE 231 will intorduce students to research in operating systems (OS).
To this end, we will perform a detailed study on the issues in
operating systems design and implementation, with special focus on
providing historical context for the research topics explored by the
community today.  After this course, you will be able to read,
understand, contextualize, and apply the concepts from cutting-edge
operating systems research to your own projects.


## COVID-19 Information

What we can expect from each other:

Each individual at UC Santa Cruz should act in the best interests of
everyone else in our community. Please take care to comply with all
university guidelines about masking in indoor settings, performing
daily symptom and badge checks, testing as required by the campus
vaccine policy, self-isolating in the event of exposure, and
respecting others’ comfort with distancing.  Please do not come to
class if your badge is not green, and expect to wear a mask at all
class sessions.  If you forget your mask, you can ask me for one;
there is a limited supply of disposable masks in each classroom.

If you are ill or suspect you may have been exposed to someone who is
ill, or if you have symptoms that are in any way similar to those of
COVID-19, please err on the side of caution and stay home until you
are well or have tested negative after an exposure.  Please
communicate with me if you experience an illness or exposure that
requires you to miss class sessions; I will provide you with options
so that you can continue to make progress in the course.  that you can
keep making progress


What you can expect from me:

I have designed our course following campus guidance and with current
public health guidelines in mind. However, these guidelines may change
in accordance with shifting infection rates or the emergence of new
variants. If updated public health recommendations and university
requirements make our current course format unfeasible, or if I
experience a need to self-isolate, I will alter the format. This may
include moving in-person sessions onto Zoom and/or modifying course
assignments to work in a remote format. I will communicate clearly
with you via email about any changes that occur. I will provide as
much advance warning as possible and give you all the information you
need to transition smoothly to the new format. If you have questions
about the changes, please reach out to me so I can answer them.


## Instructor Information

My name is Andrew Quinn; in this course you can address me as
`Andrew'. The best way to contact me is through email
(aquinn1@ucsc.edu). If you would like to meet in person, please email
me to setup a time.

## Learning Outcomes

As stated above, the goal of CSE is to introduce students to research
in operating systems.  The skills developed through this course will
help students think critically and contribute to the operating systems
research community.  More specifically, this course has the following
objectives:

- At the end of this course, students will be able to 
- At the end of this course, students will be able to 
- At the end of this course, students will be able to 

The skills practiced in this course are critical for success in
software development and reserach across related subfields of computer
science.

## Prerequisites

Success in this course will require prior engagment with operating
systems concepts including processes, file systems, and virtual
memory.  Students will be most succesful if they have taken CSE 130 or
an equivalent course at another university.

## Required Materials, Textbooks, and Technology

Students will need access to a personal computer for sucess in this
course.  Please contact me if you have hardship in securing a
computer; UCSC has programs that can help you.

## Assignments and Assessement

The learning outcomes will be assessed through the following:
- (40%) Course Project : You will work with a team to perform a
  systems research project.  Deliverables will include a proposal,
  mid-term presentation, final presentation, and final research paper.
  This assignment will provide you with the experience of performing
  research in the operating systems field.
- (10%) Paper Reviews: We will be writing reviews for the papers that
  we read in this course.  These reviews will help practice critical
  examination of OS papers.  You are able to skip a total of two
  reviews across the quarter (choose wisely!).  Reviews will be due
  through `hotCRP' (check back for a link).  We will discuss the
  guidelines for writing reviews during the first week of the course.
- (15%) Paper Presentations: Each student will be responsible for
  presenting and leading the discussion of one-two papers that we read
  this semester.  You will be able to choose the papers that you
  present.  I will discuss Guidelines for presentations during the
  first week of the course.
- (10%) Participation: Much of the discovery and learning in this
  course will be dirven by in-class discussion.  Participation will be
  assessed by engagement during in-class discussions.
- (15%) Quizes: We will have two quizes to assess how well students
  are able to apply the operating systems concepts that we have
  learned.  These will be short take-home quizes. 


I will provide timely feedback on assignments so that you know how
your learning is progressing.  Paper reviews will likely take 1--2
hours to complete, especially if you are unfamiliar with the related
work.  Paper presentations will likely require closer to 3 hours.
Finally, I expect that the quizes will require at most 2 hours to
complete.  Let me know if you are consistently struggling to perfom
these tasks in the stated amount of time, it is likely that you are
doing more than is necessary.


## Student Feedback

In the first third of this course, I will solicit feedback to help
make sure that you are learning effectively.  At the end of the
quarter you will be asked to complete a Student Experience of Teaching
survey for this course. SETs provide an opportunity for you to give
valuable feedback on your learning that is honest and
constructive. This anonymous feedback will help me consider
modifications to the course that will help future students learn more
effectively.

## Academic Integrity

All members of the UCSC community benefit from an environment of
trust, honesty, fairness, respect, and responsibility. You are
expected to present your own work and acknowledge the work of others
in order to preserve the integrity of scholarship.

Academic integrity includes:

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, the following:

## Principles of Community

                                                                                                   
The University of California, Santa Cruz expressly prohibits students
from engaging in conduct constituting unlawful discrimination,
harassment or bias
(https://reporthate.ucsc.edu/principles-and-policies/index.html).  I
am committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects
diversity and supports inclusivity. We need to work together to build
this community of learning. I ask all members of this class to:
- be open to and interested in the views of others consider the
  possibility that your views may change over the course of the term
- be aware that this course asks you to reconsider some “common sense”
  notions you may hold honor the unique life experiences of your
  colleagues
- appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other
  listen to each other’s opinions and communicate in a respectful
  manner
- keep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal
  (or professional) nature
- ground your comments in the work we are studying. Refer frequently
  to the texts and make them the focus of your questions, comments,
  and arguments. This is the single most effective way to ensure
  respectful discussion and to create a space where we are all
  learning together.
